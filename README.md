# Welcome

Hi, I'm **Kirill**, a full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript developer.
Thanks for visiting this repository.

This repo contains the **production build** of my personal portfolio — a place where I showcase selected projects, skills, experience, and technology stacks I've worked with.

The full interactive portfolio is available here:

**[https://developer-kirill-nefodov](https://developer-kirill-nefodov.github.io/personal-portfolio)**
(or the GitHub Pages link, if hosted there)

## About This Repository
